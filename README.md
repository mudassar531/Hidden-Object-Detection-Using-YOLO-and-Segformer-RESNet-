# Hidden-Object-Detection-Using-YOLO-and-Segformer-RESNet-
In this project, I used **YOLO**, **Segformer**, and **ResNet** to detect hidden objects in images. 🔍 YOLO provided real-time object detection, Segformer handled segmentation for precise object boundaries, and ResNet added feature extraction for accuracy. This combination boosted detection performance for challenging, concealed objects! 📸✨
